# Contribution Guidelines

## Adding something to an awesome list

If you have an awesome Teachable Machine resource to contribute, this is how you do it.

You'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)!

1. Click on the `README.md` file: 
3. Go to the edit icon. 
4. You can start editing the text of the file in the in-browser editor. 
5. Say why you're proposing the changes, and then click on "Commit".
6. Submit the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
